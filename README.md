# Public-Key-Infrastructure (PKI)
 System for the creation, storage, and distribution of digital certificates which are used to verify that a particular public key belongs to a certain entity.

## How PKI relates to Public Key cryptography
Public key infrastructure is built to facilitate effective use of public key cryptography.

In public key cryptography, the (public) encryption and (private) decryption keys differ. The public keys are published and are used for encrypting messages so that only the holder of the private decryption key is able to decrypt and read the messages. Public key infrastructure acts to ensure that the published public keys are bound to authenticated parties who hold the relevant decryption key and therefore PKI ensures that nefarious keys or questionable entities may be identified as such (by their lack of certification).

Public Key Infrastructure enables confidence that the public key found for any entity does indeed belong to that entity and not an attacker. This trust that messages, information and data will reach the intended recipient (and only said recipient) safely is necessary for asymmetric cryptosystems to be used on public networks.
